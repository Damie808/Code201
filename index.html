  Hello everybody my name is Damie I graduated from Kentwood Highschool and have some college experience but never graduated with a degree. I spent 5 years in the Army serving as an Infantryman in the 75th Ranger Regiment. My goals for the up coming year is to get back in shape and finish this course so that I can work in the tech industry.
